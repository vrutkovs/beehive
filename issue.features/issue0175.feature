Feature: Issue #175: Scenario isn't marked as 'failed' when Background step fails

  Scenario has currently status "skipped" when a background step fails.
  Expected is that scenario status should be "failed".
  Ensure that this is the case.

  RELATED: features/background.feature
  REUSE:   Scenario from there (as copy).

  | NOTE:
  |     Cucumber has a slightly different behaviour.
  |     When a background step fails the first scenario is marked as failed.
  |     But the remaining scenarios are marked as skipped.
  |
  |     This can lead to problems when you have sporadic background step failures.
  |     For this reason, beehive retries the background steps for each scenario.
