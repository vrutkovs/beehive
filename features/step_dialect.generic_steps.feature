Feature: Step dialect for generic steps

  As a test/story writer
  I want to have a possibility to use generic steps
  So that I can execute a sequence of steps without BDD keywords (Given/When/Then)

  | SPECIFICATION: Generic step
  |   * Prefix each step with a '*' (asterisk/star) character to mark it as step
  |   * Provide step-functions/step definition with "@step" decorator
