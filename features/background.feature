Feature: Background

  As a test writer
  I want to run a number of steps in each scenario
  And I want to avoid duplicating these steps for each scenario
  So that I write these steps only once (DRY principle).

  | SPECIFICATION:
  |   * A feature can have an optional "Background" section
  |   * The Background must be specified before any Scenario/ScenarioOutline
  |   * The Background may occur at most once
  |   * The Background steps are executed in each Scenario/ScenarioOutline
  |   * The Background steps are executed before any Scenario steps
  |   * If a Background step fails then the is marked as scenario failed
  |   * If a Background fails in a scenario then other scenarios are still executed.
  |
  | RELATED:
  |   * parser.background.sad_cases.feature
  |
  | NOTE:
  |   Cucumber has a slightly different runtime behaviour.
  |   When a background step fails the first scenario is marked as failed.
  |   But the remaining scenarios are marked as skipped.
  |
  |   This can lead to problems when you have sporadic background step failures.
  |   For this reason, beehive retries the background steps for each scenario.
  |   But this may lead to an increased test duration if a systematic failure
  |   occurs in the failing background step.
