Feature: Steps Formatter (Step Definitions Formatter)

    As a test writer
    I want to get a quick overview which step definitions exist
    To simplify the writing of feature tests.

    | SOLUTION: Use StepsFormatter in dry-run mode, like:
    |
    |       beehive --dry-run -f steps features/
    |
    | NOTE: This formatter is similar to the "stepdefs" formatter in cucumber.
