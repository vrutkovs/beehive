Feature: Setup logging_format

  As a tester
  I want to configure the logging_format for log_capture mode
  So that log-records are shown in my preferred format.

  As a tester
  I want to configure the logging_format for logging mode (no-log_capture)
  So that log-records are shown in my preferred format.

  | SPECIFICATION:
  |  * logging_format can be defined on command-line
  |  * logging_format can be defined in beehive configuration file
  |
  | NOTE:
  |  The log record format can also be defined in a logging configuration file.
