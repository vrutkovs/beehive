  Scenario: Feature Setup
    Given a new working directory
    And an empty file named "features/steps/steps.py"
    And a file named "features/alice.feature" with:
        """
        Feature: Alice

    Select the following feature files: barbi.feature, bob.feature

      When I run "beehive --include='features/b.*' -f plain features/"
      Then it should pass with:

        """
      And the command output should contain:
