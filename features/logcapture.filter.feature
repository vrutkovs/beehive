Feature: Use logging_filter with logcapture

  PRECONDITION: log_capture mode is enabled (config.log_capture = true).

  As a tester
  In log-capture mode
  I want to include/exclude log-records from some logging categories
  So that the output is not cluttered with unneeded information in case of failures.

    Background:
      Given I define the log record schema:
          | category | level | message         |
          | root     | ERROR | __LOG_MESSAGE__ |
