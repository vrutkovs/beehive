Feature: Steps Usage Formatter

    As a test writer
    I want to get an overview which step definitions are used and where
    To simplify the refactoring of step definitions (and features).

    | SOLUTION: Use StepsUsageFormatter in dry-run mode, like:
    |
    |       beehive --dry-run -f steps.usage features/
    |
    | NOTE: This formatter corresponds to the "usage" formatter in cucumber.
