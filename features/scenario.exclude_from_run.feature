Feature: Exclude Scenario from Test Run

    As a test writer
    I want sometimes to decide at runtime
    that a scenario is excluded from a test run
    So that the command-line configuration becomes simpler
    (and auto-configuration is supported).

    | MECHANISM:
    |   The "before_scenario()" hook can decide just before a scenario should run
    |   that the scenario should be excluded from the test-run.
    |   NOTE: Hooks are not called in dry-run mode.
    |
    | RATIONALE:
    |   There are certain situations where it is better to skip a scenario
    |   than to run and fail the scenario.
    |
    |   Reasons for these cases are of often test environment related:
    |     * test environment does not fulfill the desired criteria
    |     * used testbed does not fulfill test requirements
    |
    |   Instead of providing the exclude-scenario selection on the command-line,
    |   the test (environment) and configuration logic should determine
    |   if a test should be excluded (as auto-configuration functionality).
    |
    | EXAMPLE:
    |   Certain scenarios should not run on Windows (or Linux, ...).
    |
    | EVALUATION ORDER:
    |   Before the user can exclude a scenario from a test-run,
    |   additional mechanisms decide, if the scenario is part of the selected run-set.
    |   These are:
    |     * tags
    |     * ...
    |
